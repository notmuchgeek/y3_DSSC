1. prepare natural dyes for DSSC with Turmeric, beetroot, blueberries 
2. Dilute the solution to get a similar concentration (according to the transparency) as Z907 provided
3. [Spectrum] Measure the absorption spectrum for the clean FTO glass with TiO2
4. [4*Spectra] Measure the absorption spectra for the natural dyes
5. Cleam all the FTO glass with TiO2 with Propanol and left them in the oven to 450C for 10 min
6. Allow the glasses cool to ~80C
7. Transfer these glasses to dye solutions (8 Nov, 4.00PM)

[Measure] Spectra for dye solutions and films
A: Compare between different dyes
B: Compare with and without dyes
C: Relationship between the Isc with illumination intensity (photocurrent action spectrum)
---------------------
1. Make sure the deposited films stored properly in the dye solution or in propylene carbonate
2. [2*Spectra] Measure the spectrum for dye solution and the film. (Use the ref cell as an example) Take one rinsed and counter electrodes and place both in the sample holder.

2.2. [New Set] Repeat I-V curve measure without dye
- if the output is stable
- if the unstablility related to light intensity
- will the curve the same as the one adding the dye

3. Add one or two iodide/iodine electrolyte into the cell, add more when dried out
4. Make sure the electric shorts are avoided
5. [I-V curve] Measure the I-V curve with the LabView for a defined light intensity, after a certain period of time. Ensure the reference cell is evenly illuminated and centred in the middle of the light beam.
- voltage: 0-0.7 V
- 1/10th full sun intensity

- Voc
-Isc
- potimum power output
- power coversion efficiency
-fill factor

-Effiency change with time??
6. Measure Isc with illumination wavelength for ref. cell
7. Calculate the current for my cells and measure with propert picoammeter again.
